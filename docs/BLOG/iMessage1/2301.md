## 【iM mass deployment, what is Apple push】

- Apple Calendar Push, configure iOS devices: you can create custom profiles
Apple Configurator is a tool officially provided by Apple, mainly for enterprises and educational institutions, for centralized management and configuration of multiple iOS devices.

Using Apple Configurator, you can do the following on your PC:

Configure iOS devices: You can create custom profiles, including network settings, security settings, app access, and more, and then apply these profiles to multiple iOS devices for consistent configuration.

App deployment: You can batch install apps, books, and other media files to multiple iOS devices without having to install them manually on a device-by-device basis.

Device monitoring and management: You can monitor connected iOS devices and view their status, app usage, and device information. You can also perform management operations such as device locking, unlocking, and factory reset.
Explicit App ID (clear APP ID), the general format is: com.domainname.appname. This type of ID can only be used on one app. One needs to be created for every new application.
Wildcard App ID (wildcard APP ID), the general format is: com.domainname.*. This kind of ID can be used in multiple applications, which is convenient, but applications using this kind of ID cannot use the notification function, so it is not often used.



iOS Certificates
ios certificates are certificates. Its function is to confirm that your mac has the permission to develop or publish applications under a certain developer account. And there are two types of certificates, one is development certificate; the other is release certificate or production certificate.
1.development certificate
A development certificate is a tool that proves your mac has the ability to develop and debug your programs on a real machine. But each certificate is associated with a developer account, that is to say, you can only use this certificate to develop applications under this account. It uses the bundle id to know whether the application belongs to your own account. So every time you develop an application for a developer account, you need the development certificate created by this account.
2.Production certificate
The production certificate proves whether your mac has the permission to publish applications. When archiving to the appstore, you must have a production certificate, otherwise the upload will fail.
3. Root certificate
Whether it is a development certificate or a production certificate, it must be derived from the root certificate. The root certificate is the certificate generated by the root mac. The certificate saved on the menber center is the root certificate. It can only be installed on the mac where it was created. Other development macs must export the certificate from the root mac for use. That is, all sub-certificates can only be derived from the root certificate.

iOS Provisioning Profiles
The description file is used to identify whether a device has the permission to install an application (in short, it is the relationship between the application and the certificate, pay special attention to the expiration date of the certificate and description file, once the application expires, it cannot be used). Description files are divided into development description files and release description files. The release description files are divided into temporary release description files and formal release description files.
1. development provisioning profile
Development description file, creating it requires bundle ID + development certificate + test device (added in devices); the three must correspond when compiling, otherwise the compiler will report an error.
2. Temporary release description file (distribution ad hoc)
Temporary publishing profiles are used for publishing on unlimited devices. Creating it requires bundle ID + publishing certificate + publishing device, and the three must also correspond when compiling.
3. Official release description file (distribution appstore/distribution ad house)
The official release description files created for personal accounts and corporate accounts are different. Since the personal account is published on appstore, the distribution appstore description file is created, while the enterprise account can only be published internally, so the distribution ad house description file is created. But the things they need to create are the same: bundle ID + publishing certificate. Because they are installed on indeterminate devices, there is no need to pick the device.

2. Add team members to Apple development account
After applying for a company or enterprise-level Apple developer account, you can add team members for collaborative development.
Team members have three roles, namely Agent, Admin, and Member.
Agent: It is the one who registered the developer account and has the highest authority. Only this account can be used to renew and create developer certificates;
Administrator: manages distribution certificates, manages test equipment, manages application configurations, etc., there can be multiple;
Member: No administrative rights, can only download and request data, there can be multiple.
For a detailed introduction to team members, please see: Private Documents
Go to the Developer Center to log in to your developer account. You can see the following developer information:



Add team members:
1. Log in to the Developer Center using an agent or administrator account
2. Select People

3. Select Invite People

4. You can be invited to become an administrator or a developer, just fill in the email address corresponding to the developer's Apple ID (you can fill in one or more), and you need to take charge within 30 days.

5. After clicking the Invite button, an email will be sent to the added person's mailbox. Click View invitation, and then select Accept to become a developer.


This adds a new developer.

6. You can change the permissions of other administrators or remove other administrators and members

See official documentation

3. Development certificate, production certificate, description file, AppID relationship and generation.
First of all, you need to apply for a certificate and follow the tutorial on applying for an Apple developer account. If you don’t have one yet, apply for one or borrow one. I won’t go into details here.
Log in to the Developer Center. If you have not applied for a certificate, the interface is as follows:

If there is a certificate, the login interface is as follows:

Once you have an account, you can officially develop and put it on the shelves. The detailed process is as follows:
1. Generate development and release certificates
(1). Obtain the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file through the keychain.
Select "Keychain Access" - "Certificate Assistant" - "Request a certificate from a certificate issuing authority...", as shown below:

Fill in the email address and common name, select "Save to disk", and a CSR file will be generated to the local disk.


(2). Log in to the Developer Center and select Certificates, Indentifiers & Profiles to obtain development and release certificates.
Certificates -> All -> +

If it is an enterprise certificate, you cannot publish the app to the App Store. In-House and Ad Hoc are publishing certificates, and iOS App Development is the development certificate. Choose to publish the certificate above

If it is a personal or company certificate, App Store and Ad Hoc is a publishing certificate, and iOS App Development is a development certificate. as follows

Choose File select the generated CSR file and click generate to generate the cer certificate.

A glimpse of the generated development and production certificates can be seen below:

Select Download to download locally, then double-click or drag to the keychain to install


2. Generate App ID.
Select Identfiers -> App IDs -> +

The Name can be filled in arbitrarily, but it cannot be Chinese or special symbols. It is mainly used for description.
The Bundle ID is exactly the same as the Bundle ID of the App, and is unique in the world. The general format is: com.domainname.appname.

You can also choose NFC, push and other functions, select Continue -> Register -> Done; the registration of App ID is completed.
System updates and restores: You can use Apple Configurator to perform system updates on your iOS device and, if necessary, restore the device to its factory settings.

It's important to note that Apple Configurator is a powerful tool, but it's primarily aimed at professional and business users. For ordinary consumers, it may be easier to use iTunes or iCloud to manage and back up iOS devices.

Please ensure that your use of Apple Configurator complies with applicable laws, licensing and privacy policies, and Apple's Terms and Conditions of Use.

For more detailed information and to download Apple Configurator, please visit Apple's official website or obtain related resources and support through other official Apple channels.

The specific steps to use Apple Configurator to deploy real-device push group control and push operations are as follows:

Download and install Apple Configurator: You can download the latest version of Apple Configurator from Apple's official website and install it according to the installation guide.

Connect the iOS device: Use a USB data cable to connect the iOS device to be group controlled to the PC.

Create a profile: In Apple Configurator, you can create a customized profile that includes network settings, security settings, app access, and more. Profiles can be personalized to suit your needs.

App deployment: In Apple Configurator, you can batch install apps, books, and other media files to connected iOS devices. You can select downloaded apps to install, or distribute them through Apple's Enterprise Developer Account.

Configure push settings: In Apple Configurator, you can configure push settings, including settings for push certificates and push notifications. This allows you to send push notifications to iOS devices for group actions and notifications.

Perform group control operations: Once configuration files and applications are deployed, you can perform group control operations, such as one-click startup, closing applications, modifying settings, etc. These actions will apply to all connected iOS devices simultaneously.
