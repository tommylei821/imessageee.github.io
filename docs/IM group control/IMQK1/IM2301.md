# 【IM Apple launches iMessage】

## 【Apple's real machine push automatically assigns tasks, automatically assigns tasks, allowing you to target mid-to-high-end customers】

In practice, you'll need to adjust accordingly based on the programming language and libraries you use.


Establish a connection to APNs:
Use Python's http2 library to establish connections to APNs. First, you need to prepare your certificate and key.
Ns (Apple Push Ontification service) service is the core of remote notification. The service is sound, secure, and efficient, and developers can easily push notifications to iOS tvOS macOS terminal devices.

When the application runs on the user device, a secure data exchange connection is established between the user device and APNs. The application receives notifications through this connection. explained in the following section
It is configured and deployed by you, and you need to write the server-side functions. The following figure shows the delivery process of remote notification:

When the server and mobile application are configured, the server can send push requests to APNs. APNs receives and sends corresponding notification information to each target setting. After the terminal device (iOS macOS tvOS) receives the notification, the system delivers the information to your application and manages the user's interaction with the notification.

The quality of service component of APNs can implement the function of storing and then sending. When APNs sends a notification to an offline device, APNs stores the notification (for a certain period of time) and delivers it to the device when the device comes online. This storage function only stores the most recent notifications for an app on a device. If the device is offline, sending a notification to the device will clear the previously stored notification. If a device is offline for too long, all stored notifications sent to the device will be dismissed.
#include <iostream>
python
Copy code
import http2
import ssl

apns_host = "api.push.apple.com"
apns_port = 443
certificate_path = "/path/to/your/certificate.pem"
private_key_path = "/path/to/your/private-key.pem"

ssl_context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
ssl_context.load_cert_chain(certfile=certificate_path, keyfile=private_key_path)

connection = http2.connect(apns_host, apns_port, ssl_context=ssl_context)
Create a push request:
Create a push notification in JSON format and send it to APNs using the established connection.

python
Copy code
import json

device_token = "your-device-token"
notification = {
     "aps": {
         "alert": {
             "title": "Your Title",
             "body": "Your Message"
         },
         "sound": "default",
         "badge": 1

headers = {
     ":method": "POST",
     ":scheme": "https",
     ":path": f"/3/device/{device_token}",
     "authorization": f"bearer {bearer_token}", # Your bearer token
     "content-type": "application/json",
     "apns-push-type": "alert"
}

stream = connection.request(headers, body=json.dumps(notification))
Handling push responses:
Process the results of the push by reading the response returned from APNs.

python
Copy code
response = connection.get_response(stream)

if response.status == 200:
     print("Push notification successfully sent")
else:
     print(f"Failed to send push notification. HTTP status: {response.status}")
This example shows how to use the http2 library in Python to establish a connection to APNs, create push requests, and handle push responses. But please note that this is a simplified example. In actual applications, you may need to deal with more details, such as error handling, retry mechanism, etc.

For complete code examples and more details, you may want to consult APNs' official documentation and related development resources to ensure your implementation is accurate and secure.

Also, please note that I can't provide full code and pictures here, but hopefully this example will help you better understand the process of connection establishment with APNs, push request creation, and push response processing.
