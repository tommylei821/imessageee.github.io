## 【Apple Mass Sending】Easily realize the open source needs of iMessage mass sending technology

I believe that many iPhone users have been harassed by Imessage, in addition to Marmei ads, the spam ads of the past two years seem to have all kinds of strange ways to enter your iPhone without dead ends, such as the most common emails and calendar invitations.


These ads have iOS-to-iOS functionality. It's difficult to find ways to disrupt users who are unfamiliar with the device. In addition to iMessage, calendar and email, many users also encounter "album" ads. What is advertised is actually the iPhone's "Share Album" feature, and we might want to know how the sender is pushed to another iPhone. Open the Photos app, and in the Albums tab, click "+" and then click "New Shared Album." The next step is to name the shared enamel, where the sender enters the ad details; once complete enter the AppleId of the recipient and this ad will be sent.


This ad is very low-key, requiring only an AppleID and no other information from the sender can be seen. So much, how should this problem be solved? Very simple, turn off iCloud calendar sharing, photo sharing can. However, icloud photos are usually used by many people. After shutting down, there is no doubt that the iPhone experience suffers. So I suggest you disclose your AppleID account online, unless other people can't get your account, they can't send you your ads
