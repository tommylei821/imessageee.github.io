## 【imessage Apple Photo Album Push Album】What’s going on with AD?

Apple message push, certificate path error java.io ioprection: derinputstream.getlength(): lengthtag = 111, tools.
Apple push, the key to discovering the local path is no problem. Just put it in the project and compile it and then the query found that the Maven plugin gave the key button so it filtered in the POM.xml file i.e. the maintenance of the original key button was successful with the following file

org.apache.maven.plugins maven-resources-plugin UTF-8 pem pfx p12 I want to use !


I want to use
JavaApns (open source project) sends push notifications to iPhone.
But I got an error.
I use .pem files as certificates. Is this a .p12 file? I'm not sure, but I've seen the difference between these file formats online.
Here is the code:
apnsserviceservice=
apns.newservice()
.withcert("gpk.pem","xxxx")

.withsandboxdestination()
  put up ();
stringpayload = apns.newpayload(). Alert BOST ("Cannot release!"). put up ();
stringToken = "thetkeenisremogther";
