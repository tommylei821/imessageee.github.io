## 【Apple pushes】About Apple development certificates, release certificates, development push certificates

One question, and I'll get this right first, is that whether or not your application requires push email, you have no impact on your application based on what I've said. Of course, it is also recommended that you use Apple's push feature, 100% reach rate, rather than Android's overmixing, where you can't guarantee the speed of your email. Without further ado, here’s the official start: 1. Start Board -> Keyboard Access! [Insert image here]


Create your application (if already created, see step 6) Click "Continue".6 If you already have an application, enter an identifier to find your application, click to click after entering edit mode , check the push image to save.7, enter the development certificate application field:!



8 Edit button will appear as shown below: Click "Edit" to enter the following image: If you created the following image in the Delivery Certificate (Development, Release) action, you will have the same image as above and then you will go back. Click on buttons 1 and 2.

10. Create a development certificate description file, select your application, and note the errors:

11. Create a publish certificate annotation and check the post certificate, as shown in Figure 12. Apply the above four certificates, 2 description files, and the certificate file download description file to generate a p12 file. Download the graphic in the figure. Four certificates, download the certificate, double-click to enter the application "keychain" is the exported development certificate, the export operation of the three certificates is the same as the above export, there is no screenshot description.


13. Just use the first development test development certificate and development certificate description document (no push certificate required), but remember to select the Pushnotification function on the development tools.

14. After publishing, you just need to use the certificate and publish the certificate description file (no publishing required).

15If you use a third-party email push service, you usually need to upload a PEM type file.


This file requires the use of a "Development Push Certificate" and a "Push Delivery Certificate". The operation is as follows: a. Develop and promote the promotion certificate of P12 file, and publish the P12 file certificate, which can be placed directly on the desktop. B. Open the application "Terminal", enter CDDESKTOP, and run the command:


OpenSSLPKCS12-CLCERTS-NOKEY-OUT will generate the certificate file. PEM-I development certificate or release push certificate file.p12, enter the password after entering the input bus (the password entered when exporting the input P12 file), when the input password is entered, the input is displayed, and after the input is completed, enter the car.
